# ðŸ“Œ What's this?
This is a code shortener of frequently used basical methods for newbies like me.
Using this, you can write your code slightly faster, and read your code slightly shorter.




# ðŸ“Œ Why the hell you made this?
I'm a newbie.. I'm not good at reading code fast.. ðŸ˜©
And I think the JAVA's codes are much loOoooOooOOoonger than other recently hot programming languages!
Especially the basical methods are too long to read.. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU, SYSOs! ðŸ˜¡
I don't want to see ANY SYSOs in my codes!
So.. I decided to make this. ðŸ”§




# ðŸ“Œ How to install this and use
Assuming you're using Eclipse on Windows computer -
1. Install: Just drag in your Project's root folder in the Package Explorer
2. Load: Type this at the top of your .java file source code and you can load it
3. Use: $.*classname*(*method name*) will work.. Maybe?




# ðŸ“Œ Methods Provided
I made 3 methods as far.
Its usage are NEARLY TOTALLY SAME as original usage.
$.pr() = System.out.print()
$.pf() = System.out.printf()
$.pn() = System.out.println()



Please take my apologies for my poorly written codes.ðŸ¥º
Thank you
