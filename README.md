# 📌 What's this?
This is a code shortener of frequently used basical methods for newbies like me.<br />
Using this, you can write your code slightly faster, and read your code slightly shorter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
# 📌 Why the hell you made this?
I'm a newbie.. I'm taking hard time for just reading the JAVA code.. 😩<br />
(I think the JAVA's codes are much loOoooOooOOoonger than other recently hot programming languages!)<br />
Especially the basical methods are too long to read.. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU, SYSOs! 😡<br />
I don't want to see ANY SYSOs in my codes!<br />
So.. I decided to make this. 🔧<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
# 📌 How to install this and use
Assuming you're using Eclipse on Windows computer -<br />
1️⃣ Install: Just drag the whole "$" folder to your Project's root folder(/src/ ← here) in the Package Explorer<br />
2️⃣ Load: Type this at the top of your .java file source code and you can load it<br />
3️⃣ Use: $.*method name*(*args*) will work.. Maybe?
<br/>

# 📌 Methods Provided
I made 3 methods as far.<br/>
Its usage are NEARLY TOTALLY SAME as the original usage.<br/>
$.pr() = System.out.print()<br/>
$.pf() = System.out.printf()<br/>
$.pn() = System.out.println()<br/>
<br/>
Please take my apologies for my poorly written codes.🥺<br/>
Thank you<br/>
