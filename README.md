# 📌 What's this?
This is a code shortener of frequently used basical methods for newbies like me.<br />
Using this, you can write your code slightly faster, and read your code slightly shorter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
# 📌 Why the hell you made this?
I'm a newbie.. I'm taking hard time for just reading the JAVA code.. 😩<br />
(I think the JAVA's codes are much loOoooOooOOoonger than other recently hot programming languages!)<br />
Especially the basical methods are too long to read.. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU, SYSOs! 😡<br />
I don't want to see ANY SYSOs in my codes!<br />
So.. I decided to make this. 🔧<br />
<br />
<br />

# 📌 How to install this and use
Assuming you're using Eclipse on Windows computer -<br />
① Install: Just drag in your Project's root folder in the Package Explorer<br />
② Load: Type this at the top of your .java file source code and you can load it<br />
③ Use: $.*classname*(*method name*) will work.. Maybe?
